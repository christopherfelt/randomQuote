Random Quote Expercise from FreeCodeCamp.Com

Description: I used the Django framework to complete the Random Quote excercise. The excercise asked for an API call and consumption to be performed using front end javascript.  However, I was running into CORS issue. After doing some research, I could not resolve this issue without a backend setup. At the same point in time, I was developing my skills with Django and I had previously made api calls with Python. So, I took the opportunity to use Django and Python to solve my problem. To make the API call, I used the requests package and a created a script to get a random quote and the quote's author. Then, I called this script from the views.py script in Django. The quote information was then passed on to the html template using template tagging.
